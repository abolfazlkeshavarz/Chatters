1
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,000
France Kafka was a great Czech writer

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,920
who has come to own a part of the human

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,880
emotional Spectrum which we can now call

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,760
the Kafkaesque and which thanks to him

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,119
we're able better to recognize and to

6
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:24,359
gain a measure of perspective over and

7
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,000
relief from kafka's World Isn't Pleasant

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,240
it feels in many ways like a nightmare

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,880
and yet it's a place where many of us

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,640
will even if only for a time in the dark

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,719
periods of Our Lives end up we're in the

12
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:40,120
world defined by Kafka when we feel

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,719
powerless in front of authority judges

14
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,760
Aristocrats industrialists politicians

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,840
and most of all fathers when we feel

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,160
that our destiny is out of our control

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,359
when we're bullied humiliated and mocked

18
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,239
by society and especially by our own

19
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,680
families we're in kafka's orbit when

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,640
we're ashamed of our bodies of our

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,920
sexual urges and feel that the best

22
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,080
thing for us might be to be killed or

23
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,680
squashed without Mercy as if we were An

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,520
Inconvenient and rather disgusting bed

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,759
bug France Kafka was born in Prague in

26
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:17,960
1883 the eldest child of a terrifyingly

27
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,280
psychologically abusive father and a

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,360
mother who was too weak and in awe of

29
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,680
her husband to protect her boy as she

30
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,680
should have done Kafka grew up timid

31
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,880
bookish meek and full of self- hatred he

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,840
wanted to become a writer but it was out

33
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,280
of the question in his father's eyes so

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,840
one of the greatest German literary

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,920
Geniuses since gerter was forced to

36
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,119
spend his brief life on Earth working in

37
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,520
a series of jobs utterly beneath him in

38
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,560
a LW office and then an insurance

39
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,000
company he had a number of unsuccessful

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,880
relationships with women he couldn't

41
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,799
marry or raise a family and was

42
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,560
tormented by the strength of his sex

43
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,799
drive which made him constantly turn to

44
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,560
brothel and pornography Kafka published

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,719
very little in his lifetime just three

46
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,719
collections of short stories including

47
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,000
his best known work the metamorphosis

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,880
and he was entirely obscure and

49
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,239
unnoticed his gigantic postumus

50
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,000
reputation is based on three novels the

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,879
trial the castle and America which were

52
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,800
all unfinished because Kafka was so

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,120
dissatisfied with them he gave orders

54
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,400
that they be destroyed after his death

55
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,760
fortunately for Humanity these were

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,200
disobeyed it shouldn't sound puant or

57
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,000
reductive to suggest that one of the

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,560
major keys to understanding Kafka is to

59
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,360
Fathom the nature of his relationship

60
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,599
with his father Kafka never wrote

61
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,480
directly about this man in any of his

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,680
works but the psychology of the novels

63
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,760
is directly related to the Dynamics he

64
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,760
endured as the very unfortunate son of

65
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,800
Herman Kafka any boy who has ever felt

66
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,560
inadequate in front of or unloved by a

67
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,040
powerful father will at once relate to

68
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,560
what Kafka went through in his childhood

69
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,959
in November 1919 at the age of 36 5

70
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,319
years before his death kafa wrote a

71
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,040
47-page letter to Herman in which he

72
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,159
tried to explain how his childhood had

73
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,239
deformed him like many victims of abuse

74
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,040
Kafka never stopped hoping for some kind

75
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,360
of forgiveness from the person who had

76
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,440
so wronged him dearest father went the

77
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,879
letter you asked me recently why I

78
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,239
maintain that I'm so afraid of you as

79
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,159
usual I was unable to think of any

80
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,400
answer to your question partly for the

81
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,200
very reason that I am afraid of you and

82
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,799
partly because an explanation of the

83
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,879
grounds for this fear would mean going

84
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,799
into far more details than I could ever

85
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,439
keep in mind while talking the grown

86
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,720
Kafka abased himself before this father

87
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,159
what I would have needed was a little

88
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,439
encouragement a little friendliness but

89
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,799
I wasn't fit for that what was always

90
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,000
incomprehensible to me was your total

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,840
lack of feeling for the suffering and

92
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,920
shame you could inflict on me with your

93
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,200
words and judgments it was as though you

94
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,920
had no notion of your power kafa

95
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,079
complained of one particularly traumatic

96
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,280
incident when as a young boy he called

97
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,120
out for a glass of water and his

98
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,920
irritable father pulled the boy out of

99
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,159
his bed carried him out onto the balcony

100
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,879
and left him there to freeze in nothing

101
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,959
but his night shirt Kafka writes I was

102
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,280
quite obedient after that period but it

103
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,759
did me so much incalculable inner harm

104
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,919
even years afterwards I suffered from

105
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:21,359
the tormenting fancy that the huge man

106
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,000
my father the ultimate Authority would

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,160
come almost for no reason at all and

108
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,800
take me out of bed in the night and

109
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,919
carry me out onto the balcony and that

110
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,320
meant I was a mere nothing for him boys

111
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,320
need their father's permission to become

112
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,560
men and Herman Kafka didn't give France

113
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,440
a chance at a very early stage you

114
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,919
forbade me to speak your threat not a

115
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,800
word of contradiction and the raised

116
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,720
hand that accompanied it have been with

117
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,120
me ever since France's sense of

118
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,320
inadequacy was total I was weighed down

119
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,360
by your mere physical presence I

120
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,039
remember for instance how often we

121
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:59,320
undressed in the same bathing Hut there

122
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,800
was our skinny weakly slight you strong

123
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,960
tall broad I felt a miserable specimen

124
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,080
when we stepped out you holding me by my

125
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,360
hand a little skeleton unsteady

126
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,520
frightened of the water incapable of

127
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,880
copying your swimming strokes I was

128
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,240
frantic with

129
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,360
desperation it could hardly have been

130
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,400
worse except it was Kafka finished the

131
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,240
letter gave it to his mother Julie to

132
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,479
pass to Herman but typical of her

133
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:27,759
weakness and cowardice she didn't she

134
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,840
held on to it for a few days then

135
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,639
returned it to France and advised that

136
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,199
it would be better if her busy

137
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,520
hardworking husband never had to read

138
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,240
such a thing the poor son lacked the

139
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,960
courage ever to try again in the

140
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,960
Judgment kafka's great short story

141
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,199
written in 1912 a young businessman gor

142
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,280
is engaged to be married and lives in a

143
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,680
flat with his widowed father he's about

144
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,360
to get away from home the father is old

145
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,520
and frail gor tucks him up in bed but

146
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,680
then the father mysteriously regains his

147
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,039
strength brings upright Towers over goog

148
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,560
and denounces him for betraying everyone

149
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,840
his friends his father and the memory of

150
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,440
his mother goog can make only feeble

151
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,880
protests eventually the father condemns

152
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,759
goog to death by drowning and goog

153
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,160
obediently rushes out and plunges into

154
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,000
the nearby River after passing sentence

155
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,520
the father cries out you an innocent

156
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,360
child really but at heart you were a

157
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,800
diabolical human being the idea of

158
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,960
horrific AR arbitary judgment was to be

159
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,240
a constant in kafka's fiction it

160
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,319
reappears in the unfinished novel The

161
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,039
Trial written 2 years later but now

162
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:39,720
Kafka had developed it away from her

163
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,880
father to a vast legal apparatus with

164
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,560
judges lawyers guards and extensive

165
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,440
bureaucratic procedures when Joseph Kay

166
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,360
is arrested on the morning of his 30th

167
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,360
birthday he isn't told what he is

168
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,800
charged with he barely makes any attempt

169
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,879
to find out he feels so guilty inside he

170
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,280
just knows that he deserves punishment

171
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,160
he does try to declare in court that

172
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,400
he's innocent still without knowing what

173
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,280
the charge is and hires a lawyer but the

174
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,680
court gradually grinds him down he

175
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,680
becomes unable to think of anything

176
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,199
words fail him he can no longer do his

177
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,199
job properly and is defeated in the game

178
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,039
of office politics finally a year after

179
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,000
his arrest two grotesque looking

180
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,759
officials come to Joseph K's flat they

181
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,960
lead him to a quarry outside the city

182
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,479
and execute him by plunging a knife into

183
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,919
his heart between the judgment and the

184
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:33,800
trial Kafka wrote The Metamorphosis a

185
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,280
short story in which a traveling

186
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,960

to a beetle or a bed bug it's a story of

189
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,199
self-disgust about the treachery of

190
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,400
family and like the trial about

191
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,280
terrifying arbitrary power when Gregor

192
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,240
crawls across the floor he is in danger

193
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,720
of being stamped on by his own father

194
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,560
Gregor's family find they manage quite

195
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,680
well without him they confine him to his

196
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,240
room and Chuck rubbish at him the family

insect in the bedroom can't really be

00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,080
Gregor they start to refer to the insect

200
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,919
as it instead of him they decide that

201
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,639
somehow the insect has to go Gregor

202
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,199
listening agrees and dies quietly after

203
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,400
Gregor's death the family are slightly

204
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,000
ashamed of their behavior but only

205
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,479
slightly cfus suffered from ill health

206
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:25,960
for a lot of his life in 1924 when he

207
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,520
was 41 he developed lenial tuberculosis

208
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,960
which prevented him from eating almost

209
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,440
anything without huge pain he wrote a

210
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,880
short story his last called The Hunger

211
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,360
Artist it tells the story of a public

212
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,000
performer who makes his living

213
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,039
undertaking fasts for the pleasure of

214
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,839
the public one time he manages to fast

215
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:47,440
for 40 days but gradually the hunger

216
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,560
artist's audience gets bored of his work

217
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,560
however hard he fasts they're no longer

218
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,000
impressed he gets put in a dirty old

219
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,120
cage and weakens terribly before he dies

220
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,240
he asks for forgiveness and confesses

221
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
that he should never have been admired

222
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,360
since the reason he fasted was simply

223
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,079
that he couldn't find any food he

224
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,839
enjoyed shortly after he dies he's

226
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,839
animal full of vigor whom the crowd love

227
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,839
and who has a voracious appetite a few

242
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,760
